- As a gallery administrator, I want to log in securely before adding or editing artworks, so that only authorized users can modify the collection.
- As a visitor, I want to browse all artworks in the gallery so I can discover new art
- As a visitor, I want to search for specific artworks, artists, or styles
- As an administrator, I want to add new artworks with complete details including images, prices, and descriptions
